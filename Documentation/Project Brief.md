# Project Brief: SOHO Network Design and Simulation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **design and simulation of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network** using virtual machines and **Windows Firewall** to demonstrate secure, cost-effective IT infrastructure management in a virtualized environment.

## Objective

To create a fully functional and secure SOHO network that supports staff and guest connectivity, centralized storage, automated backups, and network segmentation — all within a defined budget.

## Key Deliverables

- **Network topology design** featuring x2 staff PCs, a guest PC, and a dedicated file/backup server.
- **Hardware budget plan** capped at R70,000, detailing cost-effective, performance-based selections.
- **Virtual machine environment** using Windows and Linux systems for multi-platform simulation.
- **Network segmentation and access control** implemented via Windows Firewall rules to simulate VLAN behavior.
- **Backup and printer-sharing setup** demonstrating practical end-user support operations.
- **Testing and validation** through connectivity checks, resource sharing, and firewall rule verification.

## Technical Implementation

- Designed network topology using **Draw.io** with labeled IP addressing schemes.
- Configured **Windows and Linux virtual machines** to simulate staff and guest systems.
- Implemented **Windows Firewall rules** to restrict guest access to internal resources while maintaining internet access.
- Created **scheduled backups** on the file server and implemented a **partition for backup storage**.
- Shared resources and verified network connectivity between staff PCs and the server.
- Demonstrated **network isolation**, ensuring guest PCs could access the internet but not internal data servers.
- Documented IP configurations, topology diagrams, and screenshots of system connectivity.

## Technologies Used

- Draw.io
- VMware Workstation / VirtualBox
- Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu
- Windows Firewall
- Google Sheets

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed strong understanding of **network design**, virtualization, and **segmentation**.
- Gained practical experience in **firewall configuration**, access control, and data backup.
- Enhanced ability to **plan and implement secure**, cost-efficient IT infrastructure for small business environments.
